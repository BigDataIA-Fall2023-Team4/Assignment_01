# Problem Statement:

Our team's task involves developing a tool enabling analysts to load PDF documents and generate summaries. We are evaluating Nougat and PyPDF libraries for this purpose, using PDF files from [Sec forms](https://www.sec.gov/forms) as data sources. The project entails building a Streamlit-based app that accepts PDF links and offers users the choice between Nougat and PyPDF for parsing. We will test 5-10 SEC PDFs, provide recommendations based on library pros and cons, and integrate project architecture diagrams into the Streamlit application.
